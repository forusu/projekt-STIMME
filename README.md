# projekt-STIMME
Digital recreation of the GDR-made voice synthesiser STIMME used for number station transmissions.

Currently WIP.

Keypad and the following buttons are operational, everything else is currently not.
```
EX - execute
RES, CLR - clear the memory
: - Achtung
/ - Trennung
+ - Ende
```

```
TODO:
* Ability to record the transmission
* Three Note Oddity (G04) idle pattern on the ? button
* Better page layout and design
* Digital screen replica of the original / ability to view the current input
* Fix all sound samples
* Add a radio filter for a more authentic experience of listening to this on the shortwave
```

Painstakingly crafted by isakkr and me
