# projekt-STIMME
Digital recreation of the DDR-made digital speech generator STIMME (Device 32620) used for number station transmissions. Voicebank that is simulated is the German one.

Currently WIP.

Keypad and the following buttons are operational, everything else is currently not.
```
EX - execute
RES, CLR - clear the memory
: - Achtung
/ - Trennung
+ - Ende
```

```
TODO:
* Ability to record the transmission
* Three Note Oddity (G04) idle pattern on the ? button
* Better page layout and design
* Digital screen replica of the original / ability to view the current input
* Fix all sound samples
* Add a radio filter for a more authentic experience of listening to this on the shortwave
* Potential swapping of the voicebanks
* Potential ability of switching between transmission modes ( Speech / Morse / Standard )
```
